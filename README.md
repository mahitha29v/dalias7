# 💼 Career & Coding Tools

This repository contains a collection of tools and experiments focused on career guidance and software development. The work is implemented using **Python scripts** and **Jupyter Notebooks**, allowing for both code execution and interactive exploration.

project 1:💼 Career Suggestion Model (Built in Google Colab)

This project is a machine learning-based career recommendation system focused on software-related roles. It was developed entirely in **Google Colab**, using a custom dataset and a **Random Forest classifier** that achieved **82% accuracy**.

 📊 What It Does
- Uses a dataset containing user preferences, interests, and skill indicators
- Asks targeted questions like:
  - “Do you enjoy solving algorithmic problems?”
  - “Are you interested in debugging code?”
  - “Would you prefer frontend or backend development?”
- Predicts suitable software careers such as:
  - Software Developer
  - Data Analyst
  - Backend Engineer
  - QA Tester,.....etc

🧠 Technologies Used
- Google Colab
- Python
- Scikit-learnyes
- 

🚀 How to Run
👉 [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mahitha29v/dalias7/blob/main/career_suggestion_model.ipynb)

📌 Notes

- The dataset was manually selected and cleaned for relevance to software careers
- All model training and evaluation were done inside Colab for ease of access
- No local setup required—just open and run in your browser
